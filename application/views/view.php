                    intelligently sends feedback to the data collector and sends an alert to higher authority officials
                    if any abnormal pattern is discovered in the data collected, this tool provides a graphical user
                    interface for involved health stakeholders to analyze and visualizing data collected via Afyadata
                    mobile app for android.</p>

                <strong>How does AfyaData Manager works?</strong>
                <p class="text-faded">
                    This application works together with the android AfyaData App, where you use
                    the mobile app to collect data in the field and later on you send them to the server
                    (AfyaData Manager application) for further processing. When the data gets into the server
                    it is analyzed immediately using the natural intelligence build in to detect any indicators
                    of abnormal pattern, if found an alert is sent immediately to respective health
                    experts / response team and sending tips back to the data collector while further actions are
                    to be taken.
